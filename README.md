# Stampd Client

## Introduction

The education industry has a big problem; in addition to the student debt crisis and other issues, post-student life is often a complete mess. One of these key areas is the credentialing process. Employers and students are often left hanging while employment verifications or the general verification process takes days (or even weeks) to finish. This leaves employers at risk of being understaffed, schools in danger of being short-staffed in their registrars' offices, and students in a position of losing out on great jobs. This is exactly the part where Stampd comes in.

Stampd is a blockchain-based project that allows educational institutions to permanently issue fully verified credentials that are stamped to the Ethereum blockchain. Using blockchain technology, educational institutions can have a fast and cost-effective way to take care of their students; within minutes, a school can issue a credential and email it out, while employers can have peace of mind in knowing that there's no secret way the credential could have been modified or tampered with. This enables fast hires, low budgetary costs, and happy new employees.

Easy. Verified. Blockchain. Credentials with Stampd.

# APIs

## Auth0

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

<!-- ## 2️⃣ Payment API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. -->

## Infura

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

<!-- ## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful. -->
